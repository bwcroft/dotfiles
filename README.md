## Dotfiles
**This repository contains my personalized dotfiles, serving as a centralized configuration hub for my development environment.
It includes tailored settings, plugins, and customizations for tools such as Ghostty terminal, tmux, Neovim, Oh My Zsh, and Zsh.
The primary goal is to maintain minimal dependencies, utilizing straightforward Bash scripts for installation.
Currently, the repository includes macOS installation scripts, with plans to extend support to Linux in the future**
